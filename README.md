Recommendations for purchase of vehicle fleet.

Welcome!

This project includes scripts for acquiring vehicle data off the internet, i.e. web scraping. The analysis included exploratory analyses, visualizations, and dashboards. The final result was a vehicle recommendations report to management highlighting best vehicles to purchase based on mileage, initial price, year, make, and model, amongst other features.
