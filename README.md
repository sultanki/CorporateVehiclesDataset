Recommendations for purchase of vehicle fleet.

Welcome!

This project includes scripts for acquiring vehicle data off web sites, i.e. web scraping. The analysis included exploratory analyses, visualizations, and dashboards. The final result was a vehicle recommendations report to management highlighting which vehicles to purchase based on mileage, initial price, year, make, and model amongst other features.
